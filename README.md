# Continuation of this project has moved onto a private repo. 

# fitVision HackUTA2024
Our HackUTA2024 submission; a computer vision project aimed at analyzing bodyweight exercise form from a mobile application using Google's lightweight MoveNet kinematic single-pose thunder pose-estimation model. This is not meant to be a finished product, but rather a launch point for our project. 

Currently, fitVision analyzes your bodyweight exercise form and provides live-feedback in video format on your form. It also counts repetitions! 

## Demo

Frontend mobile app coming to a day near you soon. See our MLH DevPost here too! https://devpost.com/software/bodyweight-exercise-form-analysis

## How to run:
1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it
2. Install dependencies by performing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in GitBash with Python version 3.9.13 (not tested for other versions, will most likely work with newer versions though)
3. Perform `python backend/main.py`
4. Try a pushup! For best performance, perform it perpendicular to the camera (sideways) as shown in the video 4-5ft away.
